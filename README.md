## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Tailwind CSS](http://www.tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
    
### What I learned

I learnt how to target specific breakpoints with Tailwind.
Here's how

```jsx
 <div class="hidden md:max-lg:block"></div>
```
This syntax here simply means the `div` will be hidden except when it's in the range of `md` to `lg` breakpoints. That is as long as the screen witdth is between `768px` and `1024px` this class of `block` will apply else the `div` will be `hidden`.
